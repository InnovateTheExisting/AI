Two heuristics used for astar search are:
heuristic1 is number of tiles in wrong position. 
For the sample input given in the assignment, heuristic1 is 4

heuristic2 is the sum of Manhattan distances of all tiles from their goal
positions.
For the sample input given in the assignment, heuristic2 is 1+1+1+1 = 4

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Analysis of the above two heuristics used:
Greater the depth more number of states are enqueued/expanded in heuristic1 than heuristic2. This indicates that
heuristic2 is better for search.

Example:- For the following input
4 1 2
6 3 *
7 5 8

Optimal goal node is found at depth 9 by both the heuristics.
The number of states enqueued for astar search with heuristic1 is 22.
The number of states enqueued for astar search with heuristic2 is 11.

Twice the number of nodes are expanded/enqueued with astar search heuristic1 when compared to heuristic2. This shows
the optimality of astar with heuristic2.
